This is a place for me to store and share code I write for refreshing my Computer Science knowledge.
Here are some things I aim to cover: 

- Implementing major data structures from scratch in C
- Implement some popular algorithms (e.g. used for searching, sorting etc...)
- practice with different programming paradigms (functional, declarative, object-oriented...)
- implement different design pattens

Choice of coverage is based on my own use, yet influenced by some resources listed in the section below.

I have chosen to do implementations in C, Python and Elm. C will be used for things that are usually implemented in higher level languages (such as linked lists, basic search and sorting algorithms etc.. Python will be used when I need to focus on higher level logic. Elm will be used for functionnal programming.
